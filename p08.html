      <h1>Description</h1>

      <p>
        Let's Go To The Beach! This will be a game about growing up and learning
        to be in the world like I did, inspired by a beach near my house. The
        character that people play is like me as a kid who goes to the beach.

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        To make a grey-box version my game, I used some of the example code we
        talked about last Friday. First, I outlined all the scenes I wanted,
        including title pages and directions. Then, I began to work to create my
        first scene, which is about navigating through a field of rocks. I used
        the CC tutorials and in-class examples to make the interaction between
        the player and the rocks. I also talked with Pepi at DT Study, which was
        so awesome! This is still a work in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am hoping to prioritize creating a visual style over the next several
        weeks. Currently, I'm blending real-life and 2D styles. The type has a
        thick background stroke to create a comic-like effect.
      </p>

      <h1>Keyboard Interactions</h1>
      <p>
        I plan on using the arrow keys to move and a mouse click to put the
        crabs/seaweed/rocks in a bucket.
