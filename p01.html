      <h1>Description</h1>

      <p>
        A regular backpack that's about the size of a school bag. It's made of
        black fabric. It shows signs of use, as I used to take it everywhere.
        Furthermore, it had silver zippers, one big pocket, and a small one in
        front. The backpack has two adjustable black straps, like the ones on a
        regular backpack. Inside, there's a collection of guitar pedals. These
        pedals are like small boxes, each around the size of your hand or
        slightly larger. They're various colors—red, blue, green, and black.
        They have a size ratio of 2:1:0.5 approximately. When seen from on top,
        the side with dimension 2×1 gets divided into two sections. The top
        section has knobs and might have buttons. The lower half has a rubber
        surface to be pressed with your feet. The pedals could also be kind of
        similar to the pedals of a car. Imagine taking one of those out and
        placing it in a solid base.

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        For this first assignment, Lost and Found, my classmate Tiago described
        a beloved backpack filled with guitar pedals. He described color,
        material, and use, even going into depth about silver zippers,
        adjustable straps, and two pockets--one big and one small. In his
        description of the guitar pedals, he shares size, color, and ratio. I
        found the description of ratio to be most helpful, as someone who may
        not know what a guitar pedal is would need to know its proportions to
        accurately get familiar with the scale and shape. Tiago then continued
        to describe the pedals in further detail, specifying the perspective of
        a birds-eye-view to allow the pedals to come to life: a top half with
        small knobs and the bottom half with a rubber surface for your foot. It
        was also very helpful when he provided a similar comparison, like a car
        pedal, as reference.
      </p>

      <p>
        My interpretation of Tiago's description took three forms, and I settled
        on coding the last. In the first, I focus on the pedals. At this stage,
        I'm unsure of how I want to integrate the pedals with the backpack. In
        my second interpretation, I pretend I have an x-ray view of the bag, and
        that the pedals, which are important to Tiago, are seemingly floating in
        the top of the backpack. Lastly, in my third interpretation (thanks to
        Daniel T!) I consider a cross section. While viewing this through the
        lens of 2D primitives, this third interpretation felt most genuine to
        the 2D nature of the objects.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        In reflection, I think this exercise helped me become aware of the
        differences between visual and written communication--words really can
        really only take you so far. It would have been so different if Tiago
        had drawn his version of these objects and then I had been asked to
        replicate + interpret the drawing with code. In this interpretation, I
        intentionally did not focus on the details Tiago noted, such as the
        zipper or pedal knobs because I instead wanted to focus on larger shape,
        form, and the relative occupation of space by the objects in his
        backpack. This assignment helps me better understand perspective and the
        different ways of perceiving what we focus on and ultimately see.

        Shout out to Daniel Toretsky for the cross-section view suggestion. It
        was a gamechanger!
