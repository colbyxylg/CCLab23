        Let's Go To The Beach! This is a game about growing up and learning to
        be in the world like I did, inspired by a beach near my house. The
        character that people play is like me as a kid who goes to the beach.
        You must navigate through rocks, build a habitat for crabs, and take a
        polar plunge. Stylistically, it contrasts 2D shapes with real life, with
        chunky text. It's supposed to be silly.

        This game was challenging, especially as someone new to object-oriented
        programming. Ultimately it's rewarding, but it was hard to perfect
        interaction while creating a visual style. I'm aware that I'm putting
        faith into my user. My biggest compromise is not creating overlapping
        rocks--to compensate for not doing it, I generate more rocks so it's
        more like an obstacle course. If I had more time, I'd make the
        activities in each scene no longer 'optional' as they are now. For
        example, when you go to make the crab habitat, you can move onto the
        next scene even if you don't put everything in the bucket. I'd also make
        sure the player cannot escape the canvas. Thanks to Lauria, Pepi at DT
        Study, Coding Train, and ChatGPT!
