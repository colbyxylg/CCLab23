      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p>
        After drawing my sketches, I began to write all the pseudocode for the
        cat eyes/nose/ears. I noted some parts of ideas for interaction, like
        using random colors for the face/ears fill, but wanted to establish my
        form first. During my coding, I was reminded of the sequential
        execution: I needed to draw the whites of the eyes first, and then the
        black irises. After finishing this cat form, I moved on to how I wanted
        to incorporate interaction with mouseX, mouseY, and mousePress.
      </p>

      <p>
        I initially wanted a mousePress to trigger a change in position of
        whiskers. But then I created text based on the location of mouseX and
        mouseY positions, and I realized that I could say a new message when the
        mouse was pressed. At first, I wanted the text to replace the initial
        text but found it was simpler to move the mousePress text to a new
        position. It was really hard to see to the point I thought my code
        wasn't working. However, I then realized that it was appearing upon the
        click of a mouse but it was flashing too quickly. So, I decided to slow
        down the frame rate when the mouse was pressed. It became a cool freeze
        frame and a more digestible way of experiencing the interaction. Lastly,
        because the mousePress text enthusiastically answers the question asked
        "are you a cool cat," I wanted the cat to reflect it. So, I adjusted the
        arcs to make a smile. I was stumped at first in adjusting the right hand
        side of the mouth-- I opened a separate file to play with the paramters,
        and realized that because the arc bends in the opposite direction, I
        needed to subtract some radians (rather than add) to achieve a smile.
        After solving that last problem, I realized I had everything I needed!

      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        In reflection, I think it was meaningful and fun to make an interactive
        graphic. The form of the cat changed by selecting different colors--one
        thing I discovered is that the cats almost seem to have different
        emotions with each color. For example, the tan cat feels chill whereas a
        neon blue or pink cat feels like a party cat. One discovery (not
        pre-planned) was that it was fun to physically change the cat's
        expression, by making it smile. I think it was fun using a combination
        of mouseX/mouseY, and the relative position of mouseX/mouseY, in
        addition to mousePress to create interaction.
