      <p>
        It's hard to remember events in distinct, sequential ways. For me, I
        feel like as soon as the moment has passed it becomes one big memory
        outline. I tried to represent that in a camera, where the last photo
        taken blurs out all images, including that last one taken. I was
        inspired by a traditional strip that you might find in a photobooth.
      </p>

      <p>Below is the strip, where on the 4th image, it is blurred.</p>

        It was fun to consider a different way of viewing and capturing moments.
        Thanks to my friend Emily for their help on this!
