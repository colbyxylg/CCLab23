      <p>
        As seen in the first image, I chose to visualize time in 3 different
        ways: week/weekend, by bodily motion of standing/sitting/walking, and by
        the vibrations of my toothbrush. I decided on pursuing the week/weekend
        method of time because it felt most relevant to me, and felt like a tool
        I could develop for myself that was familiar enough to potentially be of
        use for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I decided to pursue my first idea, and explored its nuances in the
        second image. This clock would help change the way I perceive time by
        allowing me to feel more holistic. I feel very time-sensitive. For
        example, I usually feel stressed about being late. I think this type of
        consideration of time balances an incremental view (in seconds) with a
        holistic day-chunk view. Of all the ways of considering alternative
        time, I think this method is more traditional by using a visual
        "ticking" and reflecting back the days of the week--this is intentional
        because of the more rigid way I have felt, and at times, still feel
        about time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the first day, I began with the idea of thinking about a Week/End
        split of how I perceive my days. The first five days feel like they go
        slow, while the weekend always seems to fly by. I then realized that I
        not only felt time move at varied speeds for days, but even by the hour.
        My original idea was to create smaller blocks of time. When considering
        which functions I wanted to use, then transferred the time of day to 60
        seconds. Though I began by thinking about time in a row, I couldn't help
        but think a lot about time creeping and the endless cycle of weeks. This
        led me to instead do time that creeps into the canvas. I broke my week
        into 3 chunks: Monday-Wednesday, Thursday-Friday, and Saturday-Sunday. I
        tried to sit with each segment and think what kind of color? What
        typeface? Aesthetically, I chose to keep it a grayscale to reflect the
        monotony of the weeks, where it gets lighter as it approaches the
        weekend.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        Making an experimental clock asked me to become more aware of how I
        perceive, interpret, and feel time, which has actually allowed me to
        real how subjective time is. As someone more time anxious, I think this
        project helps me release some of my stress around being on time,
        especially in various contexts. It was fun to think of ways of
        representing time in alternative methods. Who knows--perhaps I will see
        time now as I've visualized it here in this project, instead of a clock
        face.
