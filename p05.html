        In this sketch, I was inspired by patterns in nature; specifically,
        patterns in succulents. Using a starting point from a sample code shared
        in class based on circles, I modified it to create a growing plant to
        emulate the shape, color, and depth of a succulent plant. I paid special
        attention to the ratios of the triangles, the fill, and the stroke
        weight. There is perspective created with the thinness of the triangles,
        so as it expands, it feels closer to 2D depth. I had to fine-tune to get
        the right triangle proportions. Time is used to create the illusion of
        the plant growing, and over time the leaves take over the whole page.
        There is a full plant spiral in the center and another partial view of a
        plant in the lower right hand corner. At first, one might not even
        notice the spiral in the corner. Yet over time, these spirals overlap
        and interlock--this symbolizes the surprising ways that nature appears
        with each itself and each other.

        I think that a version of this piece could be used on a plant website as
        the loading graphic. It would also be cool to see this as a wearable
        item. Perhaps some feature that is responsive to light, in the same way
        a plant grows in healthy sunlight. I'm imagining something in which its
        full pattern becomes more revealed as its light exposure is longer and
        longer.
