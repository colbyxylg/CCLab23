      <h1>Background Stories</h1>

      <p>
        My partners were Amber Guo and Daniel Toretsky. Amber's story is: a
        strong healthy mid-age man from 2077. He is listening to the popular
        hip-hop music. He can jump very high and move extremely fast with his
        modified robotic cyberpunk legs. He loves music! My story is: an angry
        little caterpillar man was trying to become a butterfly. He prepared
        like all the other caterpillars but accidentally ate a sea berry, so
        when he finished metamorphosis he sprouted a shark tail instead of
        wings. Unfortunately, his one dream was to flyâ€”with his transformation
        leaving him grounded, he remains angry, swimming through the seas
        forever. His cry can be heard every time a wave breaks. Daniel's story:
        TBD.

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        Below is my exquisite corpse. I drew the head, Amber drew the body, and
        Daniel drew the legs. I wanted to create a general abstraction of the
        exquisite corpse. Given our focus on functions this week, I knew I was
        going to have 3 distinct functions: drawHead(), drawBody(), and
        drawLegs(). For the head function, I focused on the shapes, lines, and
        proportions. For the body and legs, I focused on color and texture,
        using alphaValues and grayValues. I first started with the head to
        recreate a head with horns on a figure with an open mouth. It took some
        experimenting to get the right placement to accurately represent the
        proportions. Then, I considered the body that Amber drew. It was a
        rectangular silhouette of a blue man with arms. I chose a darker blue
        for the body and allowed the arms and outline of the body to be a
        brighter, lighter blue. I used the documentation and ChatGPT to help me
        understand how to use curveVertex() to get the proper curves for the
        arms. After finding the right saturation and angles, I moved onto
        creating the tail. I used an upside triangle to represent the main body
        of the figure, and overlayed two triangles to create "fins." Their
        outline and fill are slightly different colors to help create dimension.
        To make it a bit more dynamic, I added a bouncing shadow beneath.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        I think organizing code into separate functions is great! It's much more
        digestible, especially with well-named functions. I hope to use this
        going forward in any coding projects. It was fun to make up a story and
        collaborate with others, and especially interesting to see what kinds of
        characters we all gravitated towards. Thanks to Mati Pina for sharing
        helpful references about bezier curves!
