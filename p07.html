      <h1>Description</h1>

      <p>
        Let's Go To The Beach! This will be a game about growing up and learning
        to be in the world like I did, inspired by a beach near my house. The
        character that people play is like me as a kid who goes to the beach.
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        My three scenes will be like this. 0. Opening text with 'Lets go to the
        beach!' 1. Learning to walk on slippery rocks. The player will have to
        get down to the beach by walking through some slippery rocks. Use arrow
        keys to move and figure out the best path. Some rocks will be slippery
        and some won't. Jump over slippery rocks. Slippery rocks look similar to
        non-slippery rocks - darker rocks are wet. 2. You're at the beach! You
        see some little crabs scuttling under rocks. You decide to collect all
        the crabs. You have to catch them! First, you have to make little
        habitat for crabs: collect sand and rocks first. After all the sand and
        rocks have been collected, you can then click on the crabs. 3. We are at
        the beach. Take a polar plunge? Original question: "The ocean water can
        be nice to swim in. It's pretty cold though. Do you want to take a polar
        plunge?" Yes or No If yes and if sun is high in the sky, person is like
        "nice! That was refreshing" If yes sun is low in the sky, person is like
        "oh, that was cold" If no, "are you sure???" If yes, go to go home
        screen If no, go to original question 4. Time to go home! Scene fades
        out.

      <p>
        Stylistically, I plan to use a simple and elegant 2D style. I think
        you'd move through space like a platformer game like Mario, and it would
        also be similar to a text-based text game because prompts ask you to do
        different things.

      <h1>Keyboard Interactions</h1>
      <p>
        I plan on using the arrow keys to move, the space bar to jump, and a
        mouse click to put the crabs/sand/rocks in a bucket.
