        Free the Fart! This project explores the time, duration, sound, and
        strength (smelliness) of a fart in a silly way. Press the mouse
        repeatedly and you may hear some sounds :)

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        I decided to track my and my loved ones’ farts this last week. I believe
        that I am a product of my community, and as an effort to embody that, I
        opened my Google form up to friends. I collected results anonymously
        (n=17) and estimate that my entries were about half or less. In my
        Google form, I decided to count each fart and note its time, duration of
        fart, strength, and sound. I then put these entries into p5: time of
        fart is denoted by color and text, duration of fart is the dimension of
        the smokey “fart” particle, the sound of the fart is used to trigger a
        fart sound, and the strength of the fart is denoted by a wind pattern to
        the fart, where not smelly is no wind and very smelly is a strong
        right-blowing wind. I added a small amount of interaction so that a
        viewer can eagerly click, hoping to hear a silly fart sound.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        I learned that we fart a lot! I tried my best to record each fart, but
        know that some did not make it in. An older Vox article suggested we
        fart 10-20 times a day. The process of tracking this and becoming more
        aware of my body also made me more aware of my diet. I think the nuance
        of both how stinky the fart was and the duration of the fart was lost in
        the data- by representing each fart with overlapping clouds, the
        individuality of the fart becomes less prominent. Instead, the time of
        day is now more important. I think this meaningfully reflects the
        subjectivity of the fart - most people said their farts were not stinky
        and were silent. In practice, I’m curious how true this actually is.
        Self-recording leaves a lot up to interpretation! Shoutout to Joy Shen
        for helping me conceptualize this. Thanks to QuickSounds.com for the
        sound effect!
